    "Trance: Elves don't need to sleep. Instead they meditate deeply, remaining semiconscious, for 4 hours a day. While meditating, you can dream after a fashion; such dreams are actually mental exercises that have become reflexive through years of practice. After resting in such a way, you gain the same benefit that a human does from 8 hours sleep.",
